The goal is to allow the user to enter a search term,it then returns 10 images from Giphy and arrange them vertically on the page. When the user scrolls near to the bottom of the page, 10 more GIFs are fetched and appendend to the page. Whenever the user scrolls near the bottom again, 10 more GIFs appears on the page, thus creating an infinite list.
